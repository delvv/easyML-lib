================================

Introduction
------------
EasyML-lib is a bridge between Android apps and Python machine learning toolkits, enabling easy event collection and model training for recommender systems, classifiers, and other prediction models.

There are two components to this project - easymlclient is the Android library that communicates with the server-based Python system.

And easymlserver is a RESTful API built in Python and Flask to bridge to the scikit-learn, python-recsys, and other numpy/scipy based Python machine learning libraries.

This library is currently in pre-alpha state - consider it a sketch at this point.
